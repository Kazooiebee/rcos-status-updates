## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I contiued working on my new assignment. I got super stuck with promises and used some promiese and learnt some. I eneded up moving on in callback hell to be able to create a working project disector.

> Created the ability to clone and then move on after cloning a project to get the log of the commits and output that.

> It took a while to get that working becuase of many problems including promises. Also it needed to be able to navigate the structure of folders that it creates which now works.

## This Week's Plan

> Make the program be able to disect the exapmle project I made.

> Be able to analyse the git log.

> Have the program disector be able to create a tree structure with all the steps.

> Should also be able to move files.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing right now.

## Notes

> Never figured out promises, just gonna go with callback hell.
