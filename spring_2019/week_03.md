## Last Week's Accomplishments

> After being confused and left behind in the project, I met with my mentor/project leader and we talked about what I could do with the project.

> I got a new assignemtn for a project which I can work on and learn javascript and not be left behind.

> I took codeacademy lessons on basic javascript and learning things such as call back, promises in javascript.

> My new assignment is to bulid a project type converter to switch between how they will be stored and viewed. I researched two ways to do it, in python and in node, and I decided node so I could learn javascript and node.

> I am learning about node and decided the packages I need for the new project, which will be simplegit and fs.

> I started the project and working on the first parts of it. And I have input working and learning how to change to use promises to avoid callback hell.

## This Week's Plan

> Continue learning about promises

> Finish the input and add git cloning and printing out the log and starting to understand the log.

> Add functionality to use fs to create a file system.

## Anything Blocking?

> How confusing promises are.

## Notes

> I was sort of left out of the project becuase I didn't understand the new project, all my work was thrown out and I didn't know what to do or understand the project. After meeting with my mentor and project leader I feel better and have things to do.
