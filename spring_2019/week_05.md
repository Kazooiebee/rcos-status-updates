## Last Week's Accomplishments

> It is moving forward smoothly. I created an example project with certain markers put in the commits. The markers indicatev which steps are parents to other steps, and where the initial step is.

> I added the functionaility to the project disector to be able to read and interpret the markers of the test project.

> It is able to find the markers and get the git hash linked to the message markers.

> Make a tree structure of folders based on which hashes it finds.

## This Week's Plan

> Make the project disector checkout the commit related to the hash it finds.

> Be able to copy the files from the commit into the tree structure.

## Anything Blocking?

> Callback and promises still come up with more problems.
