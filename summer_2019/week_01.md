## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Joined a new rcos project. The aim is to create a easy to use groupme bot which people can use and edit to their liking. We want to make it easier for people to make groupme bots. We are using python to control to bot as python is easy to use and many people know it.

> After joining the project I helped my team mates get aquinted with git and we set up the repository and I helped them set up their own branches.

> We also got a rudimentary basic bot somewhat working but it has no functionality yet, we will divide up work this week for next week.

## This Week's Plan

> Organize the code and learn how the bot works.

> Create a system for adding functionality.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing yet.

## Notes

> N/A
