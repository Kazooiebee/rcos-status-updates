## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We got spoken to about product testing in the big meeting.

> We met in our sub groups, I am in the plugin group and I got assigned the part of creating an environment setup in atom for flask projects.

> I researched the environment setup for flask and found that Node Package Manager can install all the dependencies from a json file (which flask projects have) using a single command on windows.

> I also found a atom plugin project which can run command line arguments from the atom plugin which will be useful in finding out how I can run the NPM command from JavaScript in our atom Plugin.

> I also cloned our atom plugin and have it under source control.

## This Week's Plan

> Look into the atom command plugin and create a script that can install all the dependencies from a json file in Atom.

## Anything Blocking?

> How do atom plugins work and how to interface with windows in JavaScript (How does JavaScript even run?)

## Notes

> Making progress
