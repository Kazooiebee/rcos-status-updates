## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We learned about redis in the big meeting.

> Regarding curriculum project we got assigned to groups and I am a part of the plugin group.

> We also researched the inner workings of git, more about the open source text editor atom and creating guis within 
> Atom.

> Our plugin group meeting was assigned.

## This Week's Plan

> Meet in the plugin group for the first time. Assign roles and decide what we need to do.

> Create the open source repository for the project.

## Anything Blocking?

> No blocking yet

## Notes

> Still a little confused about the whole project but should make more sense when we get into smaller groups and
> get jobs.
