## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Uploading week3 status update now because I missed last meeting.

> Found out how to use services to link atom packages and use them and I wrote some code to provide and recieve services.

> Learned more about how javascript and atom work internally.

## This Week's Plan

> Either get the services working or instead rewrite the code for our use.

>UPDATE: found another guy who is stuck at the same point that I am but for a different reason so I can work with him to figure out how to do it.

## Anything Blocking?

> How services work I wrote code following an example but it won't work, and all the packages are so complicated and I dont understand them.

## Notes

> Stuck
