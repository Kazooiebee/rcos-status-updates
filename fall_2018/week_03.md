## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Missed this meeting therefore I am a week late in uploading this. Also last week there was not meeting
because of Tuesday's schedule.

> Worked with more packages and found more packages that have functionality that is useful but I am unsure in how to use those packages in our package.

## This Week's Plan

> Find a way to use packages in our package.

## Anything Blocking?

> How to connect and link the packages, find and use them in atom.

## Notes

> Very confusing
