## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got alot done for my project and made another push to our project repository for our team.

> After doing alot of learning about javascript and node and web development the whole thing clicked and I think I finally
understand it. I read alot about node and tried a small test project.

> Found out how to add node packages to atom using npm and apm which allows me to use node packages in our atom plugin

> Used the node package simple-git to use git functions inside our atom plugin. Using this inside our plugin added the functionality
to clone an online repository into a new directory in our plugin. This repository will be sample project which the student works on.

> Also learnt alot about coffee and started testing a system to delete the project to clone a new one using the del node package but its
not working yet.

> Starting git bash to do my stuff so learning about git too with the help of Mitch.

## This Week's Plan

> Get del package working to replace the old package.

> Find the json file and npm install the depencies of the json file of the cloned student project repository.

## Anything Blocking?

> Terrified of the del package because i think its going to delete my computer, waiting to buy a back up hard drive.

## Notes

> Really happy with the work I've done
