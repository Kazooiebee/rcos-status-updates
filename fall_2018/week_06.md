## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Talked to Ethan our project leader and he thinks that its not good to include deletion in our plugin so the new 
thing we are doing is that all the repositories are cloned into our documents folder called MyCodingAndCommunityProjects
and then if the thing they are cloning already exists then it creates another folder to put it in.

> Started implementing that and I have a system that creates that folder in the users documents and also creates the new repositories

> Made that push to a branch

## This Week's Plan

> Finally finish installing dependencies of the json file

> Polish up the code for cloning reposotories into the documents folder

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing right now

## Notes
