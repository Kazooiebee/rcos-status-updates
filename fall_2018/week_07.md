## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Made my final commits and pushed all my code onto my branch on our project repository and then made my pull request

> I figured out some plans and added some functionality for doing windows commands in our atom plugin, but it is not finished
and just ready for future semesters.

> Finished the cloning repositories and setting up code, made it neat, and fixed two bugs which were causing the names to be weird and
not cloning the project when it was supposed to.

## This Week's Plan

> Get my pull request in and submit my final rcos status update

## Anything Blocking?

> That there is no more semester left.

## Notes

> I have been forgetting to do these whoops.
